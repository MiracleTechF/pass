        <p>I am Miracle. I am writing to test my knwoledge on what i have learnt already with Angela in Udemy in conjuction with <br> Oluaka development programme(ODP)</p>
        <p>
          The most important fact for me in any job that I am being employed in is to accomplish it
          with all confidence. <br> I strive to use my computer skills to create and develop a platform
          where computer task will be achieved effectively. <br> Whenever there is a need to improve in
          my work or find myself lacking some knowledge or skills in the work that I am to do. <br> I
          will be very happy to learn something new and adapt to the current changes, hence it
          enhances my career. Meanwhile, <br> I want to be an integral part of a competitive work
          environment, which would help me to grow, both the intellectual and front, <br> thereby
          contributing to the growth and success of the organization to the best of my ability.
